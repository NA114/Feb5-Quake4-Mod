The grenade-and-blaster branch has a player.def file that sets the player's starting weapon to the grenade launcher, with starting and max ammo set to 400. The grenadelauncher.def file contains edited projectile values. The fuse time of the grenade, and its splash radius, have been increased. This branch also holds the same blaster.def file from the blaster branch.
